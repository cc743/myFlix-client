# myFlix-client

Using React and Redux, I built the client side for an application named myFlix; it is based on the myFlix existing server-side code (REST API and database).

MyFlix is a small React-based movie app that includes authentication, a movie card view including film information, a profile view where you can change details and deregister, add/remove movies to the user's list of favorite movies.

Here is a view of the main page view upon successfully logging in:
